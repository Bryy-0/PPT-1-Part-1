        <h4> Name: Brylle Christian Matias</h4>
        <h4> Nickname: Bryy</h4>

        <h4> Short Introduction  <p> I'm Brylle; most people call me Bryy, and it is also my username in most games. 
            <br> I'm 17, turning 18 in 2025. I was born in 2007 and consider myself a friendly person once you get to know me.
            <br> Some people say I look scary because of my resting face, but don't worryâ€”I'm not that intimidating; 
            <br> I'm only scary when you get on my bad side.
        </p> </h4>
